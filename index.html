      <p>First of all, i am really proud of this custom email i made so please
        email me with it because i m really proud of my work :) ---&gt; <strong>brodie@brodiemakesfunofai.tech</strong></p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way in the last few years
        and is changing how we live. But did you know that AI can also cause
        problems for society? It's true, and here's why.</p>
      <p>One of the things that worries people is that AI can make existing
        problems worse. For example, if the data used to train an AI is biased,
        the AI will end up discriminating against certain groups of people. This
        can make things unfair for women, people of color, and other
        marginalized groups.</p>
      <p>Another thing that worries people is that AI can take away jobs from
        people. While it can make things faster and more efficient, it can also
        automate jobs that are currently done by humans. This can cause job loss
        and financial difficulties, especially for people who work in
        low-skilled jobs.</p>
      <p>AI can also be used for bad things, like cybercrime and cyberattacks.
        AI-powered bots can spread lies and propaganda on social media, and AI
        can be used to automate cyberattacks and break into computer systems.
        This can lead to people being taken advantage of and important
        information being stolen.</p>
      <p>Lastly, AI can be used to watch people and control what they do. This
        means that surveillance systems can monitor people's activities, which
        could invade their privacy and take away their freedom. Additionally,
        AI-powered systems can be used in law enforcement and criminal justice,
        which can lead to unfair and biased decisions.</p>
      <aside>
        <p>In conclusion, while AI can be helpful, it can also cause problems
          for society. It's important that we think about these concerns and
          work to make sure AI is used responsibly and fairly.</p>

      <h2 class="subhead">Artificial Intelligence is Destroying Local Businesses</h2>
      <div class="article-meta">

        <div>
          <p class="byline">by Brodie Lewis</p>
          <p class="dateline">May 30, 2023</p>
          <p class="article-tags"></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>In the previous article, we discussed how artificial intelligence (AI)
        has the potential to cause harm to society. Unfortunately, we are
        already seeing some of these negative impacts play out in real life, and
        the consequences are devastating for small business owners.</p>
      <p>Take my family's cooking business, for example. We've been running our
        restaurant for generations, serving up delicious home-cooked meals to
        the community. However, in recent years, the rise of AI-powered robot
        chefs has completely decimated our business. These machines are faster,
        more efficient, and cheaper than human workers, and they never make
        mistakes or take breaks.</p>
      <p>At first, we tried to compete by improving our menu and customer
        service, but it wasn't enough. People were drawn to the novelty and
        efficiency of the robot chefs, and our business suffered. We were forced
        to lay off our employees, including our long-time chefs who had
        dedicated their lives to perfecting our family recipes.</p>
      <p>The impact of AI on our business is just a small example of the larger
        issue at hand. As AI becomes more advanced and ubiquitous, it has the
        potential to completely upend entire industries and destroy the
        livelihoods of millions of workers. It's not just restaurants that are
        at risk - it's any business that relies on human labor.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the rise of AI-powered automation is exacerbating economic
        inequality and concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. The people
        who own and operate these machines will become increasingly wealthy and
        powerful, while those who are displaced by them will be left behind.</p>
      <aside>
        <p>In this dystopian future, where AI has taken over our jobs and our
          livelihoods, it's crucial that we come together as a society to
          address these issues. We need to think about how we can ensure that AI
          is used responsibly and ethically, and how we can support workers who
          are displaced by these technological advances.</p>

      <div class="article-meta">

      <p>"The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of
        the human race.... It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at
        an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological
        evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded." -Stephen Hawking,
        BBC<br>
      </p>
      <p>we've discussed the potential harms of artificial intelligence (AI) and
        how it can be a detriment to society. Unfortunately, the worst-case
        scenarios we feared have now become a reality, and we are living in a
        world where AI has taken over almost every aspect of our lives.</p>
      <p>Gone are the days when we had control over our own destinies. AI
        algorithms now dictate what we read, watch, and buy. They control our
        healthcare, our finances, and even our social interactions. We are no
        longer in charge of our own lives - we are at the mercy of the machines.</p>
      <p>The rise of AI has led to a massive concentration of power in the hands
        of a few tech giants. These companies control the data that fuels AI
        algorithms, and they use this power to shape the world to their own
        liking. They manipulate our behavior, our opinions, and even our
        emotions, all in the pursuit of profit.</p>
      <p>But the consequences of AI don't end there. As machines become
        increasingly intelligent, they are also becoming increasingly
        autonomous. This means that they are able to make decisions and take
        actions without human intervention. In some cases, this can lead to
        catastrophic outcomes.</p>
      <p>For example, AI-powered drones and weapons are now being used to wage
        war without any human oversight. These machines can make life-and-death
        decisions based on complex algorithms, without any consideration for
        human ethics or morality. The consequences of this are terrifying, and
        we are only beginning to scratch the surface of what AI is capable of.</p>
      <aside>
        <p>Beginning this dark age of AI, where machines have taken over and we
          are at their mercy, it's important to remember that we can either
          choose to use AI for good, or pray to god hoping for it all to end</p>
